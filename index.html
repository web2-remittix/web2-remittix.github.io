Below is a detailed breakdown of its workflow, technology, and key mechanisms.
</p><p></p><h4>1. Core Technology Behind Remittix
</h4><p>Remittix leverages:</p><li>Blockchain networks (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana) for instant settlements.</li><p></p><li>Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, etc.) to avoid crypto volatility.</li><p></p><li>Smart contracts to automate transactions securely.</li><p></p><li>DeFi liquidity pools to reduce fees and improve efficiency.</li><p></p><p></p><h4>2.

</h2>

				relevant crypto/blockchain, and not fees paid to the NFT itself. Network fees vary from day to day
				depending on the network pressure.</p>
